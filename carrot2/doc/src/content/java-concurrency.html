  <h1>Algorithms and Concurrency</h1>

  <p>
    This article discusses approaches and pitfalls of running clustering algorithms
    in concurrent environments.

    <h2>Thread-safety</h2>

    <p>
      The following sentences explain the contracts required for concurrent use of
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API components:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>clustering algorithm instances are not thread-safe</strong> and cannot be used
        by multiple threads in parallel,
      </li>
      <li><strong>language component instances are thread-safe</strong> and <strong>should</strong>
        be used and reused by parallel threads.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="warning">
      Contrary to the 3.x line of Carrot<sup>2</sup>, the 4.x line has no "managed" support
      for caching, reusing or managing concurrency of clustering algorithm instances
      (previously provided by the <code>Controller</code> instance). This is a deliberate decision:
      algorithm instances are lightweight (cheap to create and discard) and modern JVMs have much better
      garbage collection mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following sections of this article show how various approaches to configuring
      the algorithm once and then reusing it in subsequent, possibly concurrent, clustering
      calls.

  <section id="ephemeral">
    <h2>Ephemeral instances</h2>

    <p>
      The simplest way to achieve thread-safety is to create the algorithm instance on the fly,
      configure it appropriately and then discard it after the clustering completes. A simple pattern
      here would be to create a function that transforms a stream of documents into a list
      of clusters:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E04_Concurrency.java"
         data-fragment="ephemeral"></pre>

    <p>
      An important assumption here is that the <code>LanguageComponents</code> object
      (<code>english</code> in the example above) has been
      initialized beforehand (once) and is reused. See the
      <a href="java-language-components.html">Language components</a> page for more information
      on initialization and customization of language resources.

  <section id="cloning">
    <h2>Cloning preconfigured instances</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes the configuration can become fairly complex. Clustering
      algorithm instances can be converted into and recreated from a map, so
      we can extract all the details from the preconfigured instance and
      then <em>deep-clone</em> it on demand, as this example shows:
