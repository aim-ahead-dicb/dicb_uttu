  <h1>Request Templates</h1>

  <p>
    This section introduces request templates and why they can be useful to detach algorithm
    configuration from actual clustering requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned in the <a href="rest-api-basics.html#clustering">introduction</a>,
    a clustering query is self-contained and must carry the three required elements:
    algorithm name, language and documents to be clustered. In practice, the first two elements
    will rarely change &ndash; once the algorithm for a particular task is chosen, it will probably
    remain constant for all clustering requests. In situations like this we can pull out
    the constant part of the query into a <strong>template</strong> and use basic
    composition with the body of a query to get the final request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another useful application of templates is to detach the algorithm and its
    configuration from the logic that queries the clustering service or to group
    different algorithms and their tuning variants under much easier to remember
    aliases.

    <h2>How to create a request template?</h2>

    <p>
      Let's explain it by walking through a simple example. For a request
      body like the one shown below, we can pull out everything up to the documents section:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/cluster-request.json"></pre>

    <p>
      Let's create a file called <code>04 foo.json</code> under DCS-relative path:
      <code>web/service/templates/04 foo.json</code>. The name (identifier)
      of the template is embedded in the file name: it is <code>foo</code>. The
      number in front of the alphanumeric name is always stripped (but it is used
      to sort the templates for display purposes).
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/template.json"></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>foo</code> template contains constant (but overrideable) elements
      of our clustering query. Once the DCS is started we can see if the template
      has been loaded by looking at the startup log message or by
      running a GET query against the <code>/list</code> endpoint:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/template-list-response.json"></pre>

    <p>
      Armed with the template <code>foo</code> we can now assemble a much simpler
      clustering request containing just the documents to be clustered:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/template-request.json"></pre>

    <p>
      When posting the documents for clustering, use the
      <code>template</code> request parameter to provide the the template name
      (<code>foo</code> in our case):
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="./examples/template-request.sh" data-language="bash"></pre>
