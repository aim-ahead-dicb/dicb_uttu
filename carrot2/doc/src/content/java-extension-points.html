  <h1>Extension Points</h1>

  <p>
    This article discusses dynamic discovery of available Carrot<sup>2</sup> components via
    service extension points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many Carrot<sup>2</sup> components, including algorithms, language components and
    their building blocks, are implemented as
    service extension points. While they can be referenced directly using explicit class
    names (<code>new LingoClusteringAlgorithm()</code>), you can also
    enumerate and inspect their properties dynamically.

  <p>
    The following code enumerates
    all available algorithm providers, checks if the given algorithm supports the English language
    and clusters the same stream of documents repeatedly.

  <p>
    A similar service extension point exists for language component providers, this time
    we use a facade method that does additional sanity checks for us
    before returning the result:
