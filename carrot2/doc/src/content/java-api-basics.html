  <h1>Java API Basics</h1>

  <p>
    This article will walk you through the basics of the Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API.
  </p>


  <section id="dependencies">
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> is a Java library (JAR) with artifacts published via
      Maven Central repositories. The following JAR contains the core APIs,
      language resources for English and the clustering algorithms:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="xml"><dependency>
  <groupId>org.carrot2</groupId>
  <artifactId>carrot2-core</artifactId>
  <version>%PROJECT_VERSION%</version>
</dependency></pre>

    <p>
      A corresponding Gradle dependency would look like this:
    </p>

    <pre data-language="groovy">implementation "org.carrot2:carrot2-core:%PROJECT_VERSION%"</pre>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Clustering non-English languages</strong>

      <p>
        Additional JARs may be required to cluster documents in languages other than English.
        Please refer to the <a href="java-language-components.html#other-languages">Language components</a> to
        see what's needed.
      </p>

    <p>
      A binary Carrot<sup>2</sup> distribution, including all examples, is always available at
      the project's <a href="https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.

    <h2>API workflow</h2>

    <p>
      Using Carrot<sup>2</sup> Java API consists of the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          setting up heavy, thread-safe, reusable components (language dictionaries and auxiliary
          resources combined in an instance of the <code>LanguageComponents</code> class),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          setting up lightweight, per-thread components (clustering algorithms),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          preparing input documents and performing the actual clustering.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <section id="api-workflow:component-types">
      <h3>Heavy and lightweight components</h3>

      <p>
        Initialization of heavy components (<code>LanguageComponents</code>) may take significant time.
        <strong>Load them once and then reuse for all subsequent clustering calls</strong>.
        Heavy components are thread-safe and can be reused or shared between threads.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lightweight components, such as clustering algorithm instances, are cheap
        to instantiate so you can create a throw-away instance on-demand for
        each clustering call.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="api-workflow:clustering">
      <h3>Clustering</h3>

      <p>
        This section discusses code from the <code>E01_ClusteringBasics.java</code>
        example. It shows just the key elements required to process a stream of documents
        in English, without any parameter or language resource tuning.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, let's load the heavy components: the default resources for the English language. The
        loaded <code>LanguageComponents</code> instance is thread-safe and should be reused for
        any subsequent calls to clustering algorithms.
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
           data-fragment="setup-heavy-components"></pre>

      <p>
        Now it's time to create the lightweight component: an instance of a clustering algorithm.
        Let's pick the Lingo algorithm explicitly:
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
           data-fragment="setup-lightweight-components"></pre>

      <p>
        Once we have the heavy and lightweight components initialized, we can assemble the input
        for clustering: a stream of <code>Document</code> instances. Each document must implement a
        single method that presents its clusterable text fields to the algorithm:
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/clustering/Document.java"
           data-fragment="visitor-method"></pre>

      <p>
        In this example we will use hardcoded values from an array available in the
        <code>ExamplesData</code> class:
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/ExamplesData.java"
           data-fragment="search-results-array"></pre>

      <p>
        Because the field visitor interface is a single method, it can be implemented using a closure.
        We convert the above data array into document instances dynamically using Java streams.
        Note how we only expose the title and the snippet fields, the URL is omitted because
        it is not really clusterable text content.
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
           data-fragment="clustering-document-stream"></pre>

      <p>
        Everything is now ready to call the clustering algorithm and consume the result.
        Here we just print the top-level cluster labels and document counts to the console:
      </p>

      <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E01_ClusteringBasics.java"
           data-fragment="clustering"></pre>

      <p>
        When executed, this example should result in this output:
      </p>

      <pre data-language="plaintext">Data Mining Software, documents: 13
Knowledge Discovery, documents: 13
Data Mining Process, documents: 12
Data Mining Applications, documents: 11
Data Mining Techniques, documents: 11</pre>

  <section id="tweaking-parameters">
    <h2>Tweaking parameters</h2>

    <p>
      Each clustering algorithm will have a different set of knobs to adjust its behavior.
      All algorithms in Carrot<sup>2</sup> have public fields, documented in the generated JavaDoc
      documentation, that allow direct changes of an algorithm's settings. For example:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E02_TweakingParameters.java"
         data-fragment="parameters"></pre>

    <p>
      Note that even primitive-type parameters like <code>wordDfThreshold</code> above have to use
      setter methods to modify their value. This is because arguments are validated early and
      out-of-range or otherwise incorrect values will trigger exceptions at the exact moment they
      are set in the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a parameter's type is an interface, the concrete type variable can
      be declared and configured prior to setting the final parameter. Local-variable
      type inference (<code>var</code>) available from Java 10 on is useful to keep these
      declaration compact and still have the compiler (and IDE) provide field suggestions upon
      typing:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E02_TweakingParameters.java"
         data-fragment="complex-parameters"></pre>

    <p>
      Once an algorithm is configured, it can be reused across many subsequent (sequential)
      clustering calls. The <a href="java-concurrency.html">concurrency section</a> discusses
      approaches to running algorithms in concurrent threads.
    </p>

  <section id="customizing-dictionaries">
    <h2>Customizing dictionaries</h2>

    <p>
      The simplest way to customize word and label
      <a href="dictionaries.html">filter dictionaries</a> is to copy the
      <a href="dictionaries.html#location-of-dictionary-files:java-api">default
      dictionaries</a> to your application-specific location and provide
      a custom <code>ResourceLookup</code> implementation when loading language
      resources. The following example loads English resources from a class-relative
      classpath location.
    </p>

           data-fragment="custom-english-resources"></pre>
