  <h1>Language Components</h1>

  <p>
    In this section we describe the role and potential customisation options for language-specific
    heavyweight components.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>LanguageComponent</code> instances provide assistance and hints to improve the
    quality of clustering for a specific language. The resources associated with this task
    typically require costly processing to load and parse, so <code>LanguageComponent</code>
    instances should be <strong>created early and reused for all subsequent clustering
    calls</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single <code>LanguageComponent</code> instance can provide a number of resources to aid
    the algorithm in improving clustering quality:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>lemmatisation (stemming) routines,</li>
    <li>tokenisation (word decomposition) and decompounding routines,</li>
    <li>part of speech dictionaries,</li>
    <li>word or label filters (<a href="dictionaries.html">dictionaries</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The above list is not restricted or complete: each algorithm may require
    a different set of components to function properly and each language will have a specific set
    of components that makes sense for that particular language. All available languages
    and their provided components (interfaces) can be enumerated via service point extension,
    as shown below.
  </p>

  <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
       data-fragment="component-enumeration"></pre>

    The code above prints the following when executed, revealing providers
    and components supplied for the English language (other languages omitted):
  </p>

  <pre data-language="plaintext">  > English
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Stemmers)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.Stemmer
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Tokenizers)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.Tokenizer
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Lexical Data)]
      Component: org.carrot2.language.LabelFilter
      Component: org.carrot2.language.StopwordFilter
    [Provider: Carrot2 Core (Label Formatter)]
      Component: org.carrot2.text.preprocessing.LabelFormatter
  [...]</pre>

  <p>
    Each of the interfaces of a language component can be
    overridden. However, for the vast majority of applications
    only minor tweaks to the defaults are really needed. For example, adding ignorable
    terms and phrases specific to a given domain is a very helpful step
    to increase clustering quality
    (patent documents will have a different lexicon compared to an unrestricted e-mail corpus, for example).
    Let's take a look at how this is done first.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Some algorithms may not support all languages</strong>

    <p>
      A clustering algorithm in Carrot<sup>2</sup> may support only a subset of the languages
      available from the <code>LanguageComponentsProvider</code> extension point.
      Each clustering algorithm has a method called <code>supports(LanguageComponents lc)</code>
      which can be used to test whether the algorithm works with a given language.
    </p>
  </div>



  <section id="tweaking-lexical-filters">
    <h2>Tweaking lexical filters</h2>

    <p>
      Lexical filters are responsible for telling the algorithm whether a term or a candidate cluster
      label should be ignored. Such ignorable elements typically include function
      words like prepositions, conjunctions or domain-specific boilerplate language that
      is not a good candidate for a cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Java API defines two components (interfaces) that are part of each loaded
      <code>LanguageComponents</code> instance:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <code>StopwordFilter</code> interface controls low-level filtering
          of individual terms:
        </p>

        <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/language/StopwordFilter.java"
             data-fragment="word-filter"></pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The <code>LabelFilter</code> interface controls low-level filtering
          of undesired cluster labels.
        </p>

        <pre data-embed="%CORE%/org/carrot2/language/LabelFilter.java"
             data-fragment="label-filter"></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
      Both these components can be explicitly provided (or overridden at runtime) in a
      <code>LanguageComponents</code>
      instance but implementing a custom filter is often impractical.
      It is much easier to reuse the default implementation that builds
      filters using <a href="dictionaries.html">filter dictionaries</a> encoded in JSON.
    </p>

    <p>
      To instantiate <code>LanguageComponents</code> for a particular language with a custom
      set of dictionary resources, copy the
      <a href="dictionaries.html#location-of-dictionary-files">default resources</a>
      shipped with the distribution somewhere where your application
      can load them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>LanguageComponentsLoader</code> class has a method to provide
      a custom resource loader (<code>ResourceLookup</code> implementation)
      responsible for locating any external resources language data may ask for.
    </p>

    <p>
      To restrict the number of loaded resources to only a subset of all available languages
      (and/ or algorithms), use the loader's <code>limitToLanguages</code> and
      <code>limitToAlgorithms</code> methods. Here is a full example that
      loads English resources from a class-relative classpath location:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
         data-fragment="custom-english-resources"></pre>

    <p>
      Once loaded, the <code>LanguageComponents</code> object is ready to be used for subsequent
      clustering calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that language components loader does not track changes or reload anything
      automatically (this would be a costly operation). If your lexical resources
      change often, you'll have to resort to ephemeral dictionaries or
      a custom implementation of filtering interfaces above.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="ephemeral-dictionaries">
    <h2>Ephemeral dictionaries (lexical filters)</h2>

    <p>
      When filters for labels or stop words change frequently, reloading
      a full set of dictionaries would be slow and impractical. Ephemeral dictionaries
      are compiled for each clustering call and layered on top
      of the default <code>LanguageComponents</code> implementations.
      Please note that this adds some additional cost to each clustering call.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following example, the clustering algorithm uses the default language data for
      English but adds request-specific regular patterns to exclude undesirable labels:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
         data-fragment="use-ephemeral-dictionary"></pre>
  </section>

  <section id="tweaking-components-directly">
    <h2>Tweaking <code>LanguageComponents</code></h2>

    <p>
      When the default dictionaries or other components
      fall short of requirements, a custom replacement may be provided.
      A <code>LanguageComponents</code> instance consists
      of a set of interfaces and suppliers providing implementations of these
      interfaces. We can override any of these suppliers, creating a custom language preprocessing
      pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, let's modify the English pipeline to use a custom word stemming component.
      The supplier for this component always returns the same closure, converting the input to lower
      case:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
         data-fragment="custom-stemmer"></pre>

    <p>
      We will also replace the default <code>StopwordFilter</code> and <code>LabelFilter</code> components
      with custom filters based on hardcoded rules:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
         data-fragment="custom-lexical-data"></pre>

    <p>
      Note how the initialization of the <code>ignored</code> hash set is pulled out of the supplier.
      The cost of setting up a heavy component (creating the hash set itself in this case) can be high but
      once set up, suppliers should return instances of the component quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we have custom suppliers, overriding their default implementations
      for English is trivial:
    </p>

    <pre data-embed="%JAVA_EXAMPLES%/E03_Languages.java"
         data-fragment="custom-overrides"></pre>
  </section>

  <section id="other-languages">
    <h2>Support for other languages</h2>

    <p>
      The core Carrot<sup>2</sup> JAR supports only a limited set of popular languages.
      Additional modules add support for other languages and bring in extra resources required
      for these languages to work properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      All language extensions live under the <code>org.carrot2.lang</code> artifact
      group namespace. Note that many of them come with sizeable
      own dependencies like <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>
      analyzers or dictionaries.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-chinese</code>: Chinese (traditional
        and simplified).
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-japanese</code>: Japanese.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene-korean</code>: Korean.</li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-lucene</code>: adds support for many other languages
        supported by the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> project.
      </li>
      <li><code>carrot2-lang-polish</code>: Polish.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A language extension is automatically added to the list of supported language components if
      it can be located and loaded by Java's standard <code>ServiceLoader</code>.
