  <h1>Choosing the algorithm</h1>

  <p>
    This section offers some suggestions on how to choose the clustering algorithm suitable for
    specific input data.

    <h2>Algorithms to choose from</h2>

    <p>
      Carrot<sup>2</sup> comes with a number of clustering algorithms of varying performance and
      quality
      characteristics. There is also Lingo3G, a fast highly-tunable commercial algorithm that
      seamlessly integrates with Carrot<sup>2</sup>.

      <h3>Lingo</h3>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/wiki/pdf/osinski04-dimensionality.pdf">Lingo
        algorithm</a> employs term-document matrix dimensionality reduction techniques to figure
        out the structure of topics present in the input. The algorithm is reasonably fast and
        nicely
        separates diverse topics into separate groups. This will typically be the default algorithm
        you may want to use.

    <section id="stc">
      <h3>STC</h3>

      <p>
        The key data structure in the STC algorithm is the Generalized Suffix Tree (GST) built for
        all
        input documents. The algorithm traverses the GST to identify words and phrases that occurred
        frequently in the input documents and merges sub-groups of documents with high overlap. The
        algorithm is very fast, even for large sets of documents, but suffers from the lack of
        cluster
        diversity.

    <section id="bisecting-kmeans">
      <h3>Bisecting k-means</h3>

      <p>
        Bisecting k-means is an implementation of a generic cluster analysis technique, contrary to
        Lingo and STC which are text-specific. The algorithm attempts to recursively split
        the documents into smaller and smaller groups until the splits become unfeasible. The
        disadvantage of this algorithm is that it creates single-term labels, which are often subpar
        compared to phrase-based labels produced by STC or Lingo.

      <h3>Lingo3G</h3>

      <p>
        Lingo3G is a commercial successor to the Lingo algorithm. The algorithm
        offers much higher performance, lower memory consumption and many more tuning options
        compared to Lingo. Please refer to <a href="https://carrotsearch.com/lingo3g/">Carrot Search
        Lingo3G</a> web site for details.

  <section id="algorithm-recommendations">
    <h2>Algorithm recommendations</h2>

    <p>
      It's quite difficult to give one clear recommendation as to which algorithm is "the best". The
      decision is influenced by multiple criteria such as performance or cluster label legibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people (including us) have a subjective feeling that the Lingo-family of algorithms (<a
      href="#lingo">Lingo</a> and <a href="choosing-clustering-algorithm.html#lingo3g">Lingo3G</a>)
      delivers more intuitive and diverse clusters compared to other algorithms. Sometimes it is
      other characteristics, such as performance or cluster structure, that should be taken into
      account.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this in mind, the following table lists the scenarios for which the specific algorithm is
      best suited.
