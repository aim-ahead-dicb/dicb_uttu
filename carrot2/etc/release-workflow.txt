Release steps
-------------

* Check if the documentation contains version the soon-to-be-published
  entry and if it's complete.

* Check if all the issues are resolved

https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/issues

* Bump version number to a non-snapshot version ([versions] -> carrot2)

vi versions.toml

commit changes.

git commit -am "Bumping version."
git push

* Build and check the entire distribution. Or wait for the GH action(s) to pass

gradlew clean assemble check

* Tag the release.

export VERSION=xxx
git tag release/$VERSION -m "Release $VERSION"
git push origin release/$VERSION

* Update statically published documentation:

rm -rf build/carrot2.github.io
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:carrot2/carrot2.github.io build/carrot2.github.io

rm -rf build/carrot2.github.io/release/$VERSION/
mkdir build/carrot2.github.io/release/$VERSION/

cp -R distribution/build/dist/dcs/web/doc     build/carrot2.github.io/release/$VERSION/
cp -R distribution/build/dist/dcs/web/javadoc build/carrot2.github.io/release/$VERSION/
cd build/carrot2.github.io/

* update the 'latest' link in:
vi release/latest/index.html

git add -A .
git commit -am "Documentation for version $VERSION"
git push
cd ../..

* Go to github, find the release tag and create a release for it.

https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2/tags

Attach release binaries from: 

  distribution/build/distZip/*.zip

* Redeploy public DCS demo frontend. Go to the build plan, locate build for 
this version, create a new deployment and promote to production server.

NOTE: the staging environment requires the vps node to be (manually) started at ramnode.

* Publish to sonatype staging repo. The max workers
  limit is set there because otherwise Nexus creates multiple
  repositories automatically for all parallel threads (sigh).

gradlew publishSonatype --max-workers=1

* Go to sonatype, verify and ack the release.

https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/index.html#stagingRepositories

* Bump version number strings to the subsequent version, commit.

* Circulate release news
