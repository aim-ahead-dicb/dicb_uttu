  <h1>Promoting Health Equity through Ethical AI/ML: The Role of AI/ML in Healthcare Data Governance and Access</h1>

  <p>The healthcare sector is currently facing a significant issue concerning data governance, particularly in relation to
  health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues impacting minority populations. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of
  robust partnerships and coordination between key stakeholders, leading to gaps in data sharing, access control,
  regulatory policies, and oversight.</p>

  <p>The need for capacity building and training of informatics personnel, as well as the integration of bioethics experts
  with informaticians, is also a pressing concern.</p>

  <p>Our project aims to develop a concerted effort between two partner institutes (Tuskegee University and UTHealth at
  Houston) to strengthen data governance and facilitate the adoption of AI/ML technologies, while ensuring the ethical
  treatment and representation of minority populations.</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: green; font-size: 1em;">
    This project has been formally approved by the Ethical Committees of both UTHealth and Tuskegee University. 
    Take the survey to join us in this pioneering effort to enhance data governance and ensure the responsible use of AI/ML technologies in healthcare.
