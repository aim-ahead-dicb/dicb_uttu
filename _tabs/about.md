The project, “Promoting Health Equity through Ethical AI/ML: A Collaborative Initiative for Data Governance and Access in Healthcare,” is to strengthen data governance in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues affecting minority populations. This will be achieved through a series of team-building, needs assessment, and planning activities in Phase I of the project to establish a strong partnership between Tuskegee University and UTHealth at Houston.
