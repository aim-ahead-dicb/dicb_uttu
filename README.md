## Purpose and Role of the Awarded Project
The project, “Promoting Health Equity through Ethical AI/ML: A Collaborative Initiative for Data Governance and Access in Healthcare,” is to strengthen data governance in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues affecting minority populations. This will be achieved through a series of team-building, needs assessment, and planning activities in Phase I of the project to establish a strong partnership between UTHealth at Houston and Tuskegee University.

## Problem Statement
The healthcare sector is currently facing a significant issue concerning data governance, particularly in relation to health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues impacting minority populations. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of robust partnerships and coordination between key stakeholders, leading to gaps in data sharing, access control, regulatory policies, and oversight. The need for capacity building and training of informatics personnel, as well as the integration of bioethics experts with informaticians, is also a pressing concern. Our project aims to develop a concerted effort between two partner institutes (Tuskegee University and UTHealth at Houston) to strengthen data governance and facilitate the adoption of AI/ML technologies, while ensuring the ethical treatment and representation of minority populations.
