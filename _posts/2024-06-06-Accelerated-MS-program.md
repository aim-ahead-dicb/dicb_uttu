#### Undergraduate students have the opportunity to earn both a Bachelor of Arts/Science and a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics over the course of five years through the Undergraduate Accelerated Master’s (4+1) Program. The program is an integrated program that overlaps graduate curriculum into the student's undergraduate work, which provides the opportunity to graduate with the Bachelor’s degree and at the same time complete their graduate certificate in biomedical informatics.
#### McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston, formerly UTHealth Houston School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI) has collaboration agreements with Tuskgee University, Alabama. A student completing the 4+1 program and the Master of Science program will have the education, skill set and experience needed to enter the workforce in a variety of biomedical informatics fields.
