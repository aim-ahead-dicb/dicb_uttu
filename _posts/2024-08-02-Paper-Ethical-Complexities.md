#### This paper explores the application of W.D. Ross's pluralistic ethics to AI in healthcare and Data Governance, using Ross’s decision procedure to address the moral considerations in AI-driven decisions. We highlight the complexities of physician autonomy, AI transparency, and accountability, advocating Ross’s framework as a valuable tool for navigating contemporary ethical dilemmas in AI integration.
